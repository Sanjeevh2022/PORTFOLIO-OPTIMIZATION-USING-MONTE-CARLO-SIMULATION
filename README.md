# PORTFOLIO-OPTIMIZATION-USING-MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION
In this report, we present our findings based on the Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory, for locating an Optimal Risky Portfolio using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique. The one that offers the highest return per unit of risk measured by the Sharpe Ratio is considered an optimal risk portfolio.
